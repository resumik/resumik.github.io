# Different How?

At first, there was no innovation. Heck, we wasn't even aware of the work of others (namely [Reactive Resume](https://rxresu.me/) - [Amruth](https://amruthpillai.com/), that's truly remarkable!). To be completely honest with you, our only selling point were pretty, modern templates at no cost.

We have in mind that we are no graphics designers. We have to outsource it. Luckily, there are so many resources on the Internet, that we are in really favourable position. We fish for our resume templates on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com). Also, we plan on implementing a feature to design your own ones.

We are aware of [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org), too, though we decided to implement our own format, which describes not only the data format, but also the logical structure of a template and it's styling. Combined, it allows for even greater extensibility. It's possible to program your own template creators and other tools that work hand-in-hand with our piece of software.
